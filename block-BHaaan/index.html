                  <p> The key to a successful cat bath is preparation. After you've gathered supplies, you'll want to prep the area. The bathroom is the ideal location for this because you can shut the door, creating a safe, and quiet space while limiting her ability to flee.<br> <br>
                
                 Have the water ready before your cat enters the bathroom because the running water might make her uncomfortable. <br> <br>

                 Make sure the water is shallow, meeting the bottom of your cat's chest, and that the rinsing cups are already filled with water. You can place a non-slip mat in the tub.<br> <br>

                 Next, it's time to prep your cat. Brush her from head to toe to remove any tangles, loose hair or debris. If your cat is not comfortable with brushing or bathing, try separating these two tasks with a break in between and lots of petting and verbal praise. When you're done, grab your helper and bring your feline friend to the bathroom and close the door.<br>

                     Find a comfortable spot where you, your helper and your feline friend can all get comfortable. Trim no more than a couple of nails at a time, followed by verbal praise and brief petting.  It's ideal to keep sessions short. And don't forget to trim the extra fifth nail on each of her front legs, also known as the dewclaw.<br> <br>

                     Trim by gently squeezing the top of each digit with your thumb and index finger, exposing the nail. Go in with the nail trimmers from the side and not the top, just trimming the tip.<br> <br>

                     Be extremely careful not to cut the nail's quick (it has nerve endings and blood vessels). It's pink and you should be able to see it through the sides of the nail. You want to leave some space between the quick and where you trim.<br>
